- inflectional morphemes: glue
  - problem: irregular forms
  - solution: dual-route mechanisms
  - single-mechansm: stored in lexicon, result of rules
- eegs: mostly for inflectional morphemes
  - violation: wrong thing, look at eeg response
  - priming: expect certain word
- meg: mass electrical activity
  - m170: early decomposition
  - m350: lexical access, more decomposition
  - => decomposition
- fmri: also mostly inflection: focus on localization of inflectional processing
  - problem: irregular verbs not productive => results don't generalize well
  - central role of LIFG in processing of regular inflection => rule based processing of regular infletions
    - retrieval: expected to engage hippocampal network
- derivational omrphology: base + affixes
  - conflicting results on whether or not derived words are decomposed
  - mostly: english, german, french, spanish, finnish
  - parallel morpheme activation, semantic integration of combination
  - words and pseudwords > nonwords => decomposition extends to nonproductive morphemes
  - some say whole-word/dual-route
  - priming
