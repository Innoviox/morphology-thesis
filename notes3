look at finnish studies that compare inflections & derivations directly -> (Leminen et al., 2013)


measure inflection-ness of morpheme somehow


talk about inflection studies => how people have looked for the dual-routes

people don't think about i&d being the same thing => compare literature about it

balance test dataset across derivation & inflection

in test dataset: within derivations: pick one of each



line: high var vs low, inf vs deriv
which line better captures the deficit? is it high variation in form or high variation in meaning
inflections: look at low in variability
derivations: look at high in variability
